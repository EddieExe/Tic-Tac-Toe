# Tic-Tac-Toe
A fun, two-player Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features include alternating turns between X and O, win detection, a game draw handler, and a reset option. The design is responsive and interactive, making it a great project for practicing front-end web development and JavaScript game logic.
